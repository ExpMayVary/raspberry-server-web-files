# raspberry-server-web-files
All the files a webserver needs to serve my sites.

These files need to be added to the "html/". 

the webserver will display the file named "index.nginx-debian.html" when the ip is requested.

videos / images and other large files cant be uploaded to the repo.
so only exlude the file & video & images when pushing.
